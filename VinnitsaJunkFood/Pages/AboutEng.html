        <b>Target audience:</b><br>
        This site is suitable for anyone that likes street food. Mostly these are guys aged from 15 to 30. I believe they are the primary consumers of the junk food. 
        There are girls eating shawarma and stuff, but they are in minority accoring to my observations. 
        Kids usually are not allowed to eat that and older people think it's totally screwed.

        <b>From the author:</b><br>
        Always loved different kinds of streetfood like hot dogs, shawarmas and so on. Also I wanted to share this info with the same junk food likers like me. 
        And I wanted to train myself in web development. So that's probably how I ended up making this site. I made this site from scratch, did not used any CMS like Joomla or Wordpress.
        I believe there is very little exotic food is sold in Vinnitsa, unfortunately. 
        However using this site, active users can update the site and make the information accurate and up to date. 
        So that the regular people(which are the same users) would be able to know where to go and where they should not.
        <br />
        And again, I will be very appreciated if you guys add the outlets/assortment to the site. If anyone would do it, you'll see a bunch of new content that you were not suspecting before.

        <b>What is this site for:</b><br>
        This site is mainly to exchange the information about assortment, prices, impressions about different kinds of junkfood in my city. 
        Also the sellers could compare their outlets/prices/assortment with the competitors. But the main goal is for the users to know the actual picture of street food.

        <b>Disclaimer:</b><br>
        The site itself does not have a goal to discriminate anyone, however the users are allowed to write here whatever they want. 
        Even if some bad guy puts bad rating or writes smth bad, he will be outnumbered by regular users.
